The raw data file `1-s2.0-S0092867412015000-mmc2.xlsx` was downloaded from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412015000#app2, Bumbarger et al. *Cell* 2013. The synapse lists 
were copied into `specimen_107_synapselist.csv` and `specimen_148_synapselist.csv`, 
respectively. All other data manipulations were done programatically (see 
`scripts/process_p_pacificus.py`).
