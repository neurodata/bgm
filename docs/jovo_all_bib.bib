             variables came to take on the values they have (that is, to find a
             generative model), and to predict what the values of those
             variables would be if the naturally occurring mechanisms were
             subject to outside manipulations. For example, a randomized
             experiment is one kind of manipulation that substitutes the
             outcome of a randomizing device to set the value of a variable
             (for example, whether or not a particular new medication is given
             to a patient who has agreed to participate in a drug trial) in
             place of the naturally occurring mechanism that determines the
             variable's value. In non-experimental settings, biologists gather
             data about the gene activation levels in normally functioning
             systems in order to understand which genes affect the activation
             levels of which other genes, and to predict what the effects of
             manipulating the system to turn some genes on or off would be.
             Epidemiologists gather data about dietary habits and life
             expectancy in the general population and seek to find what dietary
             factors affect life expectancy and predict the effects of advising
             people to change their diets. Finding answers to questions about
             the mechanisms by which variables come to take on values, or
             predicting the value of a variable after some other variable has
             been manipulated, is characteristic of causal inference. If only
             non-experimental data are available, predicting the effects of
             manipulations typically involves drawing samples from one
